Don't need clock and reset signals for RTL.  Also put a circle on reset for n_rst.  This works, but create a two-way mux.  You don't need a new mux for each control signal.  Try to keep signals going from left to right not right to left.

Even if count enable is low, your rollover value checker should check the value of count + 1.  Separate track.  Combine increment mux and clear mux into one.

On left side: combinational block with mux/muxes.  In middle, count register.  oOn right, count out and adder feeding back to combinational block on left.
