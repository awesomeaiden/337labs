This works, but create a two-way mux.  You don't need a new mux for each control signal.
Even if count enable is low, your rollover value checker should check the value of count + 1.  Separate track.  Combine increment mux and clear mux into one.

For buses, indicate that it is a bus (with number)

Usually you would you use a combinational block??
