Section 2.1:

1. Which layers are used for the sections of the supply rings:

   Bottom layer is gnd and top layer is vdd

2. What are the widths of the supply ring bars and their spacing?

   Supply bar rings are 9.9 units wide.  They are spaced a 9.9 units apart.

3. What is the spacing between the inner supply ring and the core area, and which prior command controls this?

   Ask TA

Section 2.2:

1. How did the layout change after running the "place_cells.tcl" script?

   Cells were placed onto the layout in a semi-random fashion.

2. What is a rough estimate of the core utilization based on the cells?

   Looking at the layout, it looks like about 50% of the core is covered by cells.

3. How did the layout change after running the "sroute" command?

   Lines were drawn across the layout to connect the cells to the power and ground supplies

4. In what ways are the three metal layers typically used in the routing?

   Blue metal1 layer is used for power and ground supply.  Red metal2 layer is used for vertical routing.  Green metal3 layer is used for horizontal routing.

5. What percentage of the core appears to be filled with cells after running "final_route.tcl"? And which command do you think primarily resulted in the change?

  It looks like about 65+% of the cell is now covered with cells.  The add filler cells command probably caused this increase.

Section 3:

1. What are the starting and ending gate/cell level components of the critical path?

   They appear to be registers

2. How many combinational logic cells are in between?

   There are 7 combinational logic cells in between.

3. What are the starting and ending blocks (design modules) of the critical path?

   PADINC (U5) and fifo_reg[4][1]

4. Is the synthesis critical path similar to the layout one, and what are their respective delays?

   The synthesis critical path looks longer and more complicated than the layout path.  The synthesis path has a delay of 4.61 and the layout path has a delay of 4.371.

Section 4: ASK TA

1. Reduced negative slack after IO-frame adjustment?



2. What change(s) were made and why do you think they resulted in the reduction?
